# Zween Educational Website

#### I have developed a static and multi page website as a personal project to showcase frontend development skills while catering to the needs of an educational organization. This project aims to deliver a seamless user experience while providing essential information about the organization, its courses, and other relevant details.
#### Through this website I made visitors to explore comprehensive details about the educational organization, including its history, mission, vision, and core values.
